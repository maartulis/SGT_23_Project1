     3. Write a program which asks user to input the size of array. Declare and initialize array of
     whole numbers with such size. Then ask user to input numbers and fill the array.
     Then use this array to calculate and output the average value of elements in this array.
     Hint: for learning purposes, use two loops in this exercise (even though it could be implemented with single loop).
     1) In first loop just ask the numbers from user and fill the array
     2) In second loop calculate the average of elements in array.

     Example:
     Please enter count of numbers: 4
     1. please enter number: 2
     2. please enter number: 4
     3. please enter number: 4
     4. please enter number: 6
     Output:
     Average of 2 4 4 6 is 4

    System.out.println("Please enter count of numbers: ");

    }
