     Task 01 - conditions, comparison, basic calculation (45 min)

     Write a program to compare two elements:

     ●      Create two variables with the type short.

     ●      Initialize the variables with the values as You want (no Input from user needed!)

     ●      Verify which variable is the largest. Print out information in the console.

     ●      Verify which variable is the smallest. Print out information in the console.

     ●      Verify if there are any variables which are positive. Print out information in the console.

     ●      Verify if there are any variables which are less than 100. Print out information in the console.


     ●      Calculate sum of two elements, round to whole numbers and print information in the console.

     ●      Calculate differences between both numbers, output it as positive number with two numbers after the coma
