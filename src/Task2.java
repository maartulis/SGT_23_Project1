     Write a program:

     - to show a greeting message in the console if time is known.

     - to format and print out the value of the date.

     ●      Create a variable time with value 8.

     ●      Create variables day, month and year.

     ●      Initialize the variables with the values as You want.

     ●      Verify the time value:

     a.      If the value is smaller than 12, then the greeting message “Good Morning Sunshine!” will be printed out in the console.

     b.     If the value is between 13 and 19, then the greeting message “Good Afternoon. Work Hard!” will be printed out in the console.

     c.      If the value is between 20 and 24, then the greeting message “Good Evening. Get some rest!” will be printed out in the console.

     ●      Change the time variable value to 20 and look at the console. Which greeting message is printed out in the console?

     ●      Change the time variable value to -2 and look at the console. Please add correct verification in the code!

     ●      Change the time variable value to 100 and look at the console. Please add correct verification in the code!


     ●      Verify if day, month and year are correct. For example, day can not be -10, or month can not be 34, year can not be -2032. If the variables are incorrect, please inform the user. If all variables are in the correct range, please print out the date in the following format:

     YYYY/MM/DD
